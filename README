meta-osmos-demo
===============

A metadata layer for the Yocto Project (http://yoctoproject.org).

This layer provides necessary dependencies to run the Osmos game
(http://www.hemispheregames.com/osmos/). It includes a custom image
recipe, osmos-demo-image, which boots up to X and launches a terminal
window. The Osmos game itself is not included in this image, just an
environment that you can run it under.

It has been used as a demo for the MinnowBoard (http://minnowboard.org).
